# Demo-Day-Project
For my demo day project, I am creating an accessible resume generator. The resumes that are generated will reside in the browser instead of a text editor and will have comments that link up to the appropriate parts of the resume. These comments will be accessible for users who are utilizing screen readers. The project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
