  <div class="comment" id="comment1">
    <p>See the job description on the 2nd page to see how we tailored this resume to a specific job posting. <span class="hideShow">The resume is tailored all the way through, but we'll only highlight a few instances.</span></p><button type="button" id="comment1Toggle" class="hideShowToggle">Read More</button><a href="#comment1-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment2">
    <p>One place to tailor your resume is in the Summary of Qualifications (also called a Skills Summary or Profile). Since it's the first thing an employer reads in the resume, pick out the 3-4 most important things you want the employer to know about you and your background, particularly as they relate to the skills valued by the employer. Think of this as your thesis statement; you're introducing the most important concepts that you'll elaborate on later.</p><a href="#comment2-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment3">
    <p>Customer service and communication skills are two of the skills most often mentioned in the job description below. Since these are important to the employer, we want to call attention to them at the beginning. We'll do the same thing with other important or highly relevant skills/strengths we can bring to the organization.</p><a href="#comment3-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment4">
    <p>Don't just tell the reader that you're strong in certain areas. Explain why they're true.</p><a href="#comment4-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment5">
    <p>Increasing and driving membership/sales traffic is mentioned a few times in the job description below. Show ways that you've done comparable things in previous experiences.</p><a href="#comment5-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment6">
    <p>Since we're applying to a non-profit organization, we want to highlight the fact that we have experience working in a non-profit setting.</p><a href="#comment6-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment7">
    <p>This is another major component of the job description that we have experience with and should mention early on.</p><a href="#comment7-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment8">
    <p>In this case, rather than list all competencies or skills learned, we're only going to highlight those that are particularly relevant to the position, like professionalism and communication.</p><a href="#comment8-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment9">
    <p>We can't assume employers will make connections within our resume. State outright the fact that you were working while in school. It shows traits beyond the work itself, such as adaptability, organization, and work ethic. If you don't want to draw attention to your GPA, you could phrase this as, "Work 20/hours a week while a full-time student"</p><a href="#comment9-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment10">
    <p>Rather than solely talking about what you've accomplished or achieved, mention what skills you gained from it, especially if it's relevant to the job description (as this one is).</p><a href="#comment10-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment11">
    <p>Use numbers and percentages to make your point. Doing so shows attention to detail as well as quantifies your experience; supervising a class of 6-year-olds is different than supervising a class of 13-year-olds. Also, including numbers is a marketing tool because numbers stand out from text. Subconsciously our eyes are drawn to things that are different; incorporating numbers helps keep the reader's attention.</p><a href="#comment11-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment12">
    <p>We already mentioned in the Summary that we have experience increasing sponsorship partners. Now we can into more detail to explain what we accomplished and what it contributed to the organization.</p><a href="#comment12-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment13">
    <p>Since the job description mentions planning events, we want to draw attention to similar experience. However, "organized" is very broad; be specific about what this entailed: transportation, entertainment, volunteers, venue logistics, food, etc.</p><a href="#comment13-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment14">
    <p>Again, even though we introduced this strength in the Summary, we want to go into more detail in the body of the resume. Include info about how you accomplished a task or why it was important.</p><a href="#comment14-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment15">
    <p>The job description talks about working with a marketing team, so we want to show familiarity with this area, even if it wouldn't be a big part of the job for which we're applying.</p><a href="#comment15-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment16">
    <p>This job description is based in large part on an actual job posting from a large non-profit organization. Names and most identifying characteristics have been changed, but the content and requirements remain almost verbatim from the original posting.</p><a href="#comment16-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment17">
    <p>It won't always be possible to answer everything in a job description, either because you don't have enough room in your resume or - more likely - you won't have experience in every single area. Pick areas where you can highlight the experience you have and focus on those.</p><a href="#comment17-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment18">
    <p>Meeting the minimum (and/or preferred qualifications) is important, but don't just focus on these. Make sure you're answering all parts of the job description, including essential functions, certifications, daily tasks, job responsibilities, etc.</p><a href="#comment18-return"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="comment" id="comment19">
    <p>If the person in this example already had any of these certifications, they would add them to the resume.</p><a href="#comment19-return"></a>
